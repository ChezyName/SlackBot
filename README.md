# **Firebears Slack Bot v3.4.23**

The Firebears Slack Bot was invented to force people to scout without telling them, and if they are unable to complete thir scouting duties, they lose points.

## **How It Works?**
-----
At the start, it gets all the names form the `.env` file's *General Channel ID*s members list.

## **How You Can Use It?**
-----
Firstly download all the code and open up or create a `.env` file in the root directory IE `/slackbot/.env` and copy all below and just insert your API keys.

``` .env
SLACK_TOKEN=
Leader=
GeneralChannelID=
ScoutingChannelID=
TBA=
```
